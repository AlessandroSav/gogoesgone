This is typically much slower for opening a dataset. To silence this warning, consider:
1. Consolidating metadata in this existing store with zarr.consolidate_metadata().
2. Explicitly setting consolidated=False, to avoid trying to read consolidate metadata, or
3. Explicitly setting consolidated=True, to raise an error in this case instead of falling back to try reading non-consolidated metadata.
